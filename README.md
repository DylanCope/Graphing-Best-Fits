# Graphing Best Fits

The red points are positions that are being fitted to by the yellow curves. The left is a fitting
of degree 1, the middle of degree 2, and the right of degree 4. Blue points along the x-axis show
the roots of the fitted equations, as computed using the Newton-Rhapson method.

## Controls

* Click to place a point, drag to draw.
* Spacebar hides and shows the curve.
* Keys 'A' through 'G' map to best fitting with polynomials of degrees 1 through 6.
* The 'R' key resets the drawn points.
